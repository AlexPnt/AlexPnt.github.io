In our daily lifes, we follow a set of principles that guide our behaviour and actions. They help us define and distinguish the right from wrong, deal with many situations, and follow what we believe to be the right path. Therefore, I like to keep a list of personal core values that I enjoy following. 

* Listen.
* Observe.
* Communicate. 
* Be positive.
* Enjoy moments.
* Do not ignore your intuiton.
* Handle stressful situations with calm and patiente.
* Things are built by increments. So focus on the small units and in time, you will achieve the bigger picture.
* You cannot change the past, but you can affect the future.
* Avoid multitasking.
* Have a passion.
* Think and Ask.
* Keep learning.
* Experiment.     
* Exercise.
